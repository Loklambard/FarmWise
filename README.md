Crop disease prediction and its cure 

# Overview

The Crop Disease Prediction project is designed to help farmers detect diseases in crops, specifically cotton, using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The project aims to provide actionable insights and treatment recommendations to farmers through a mobile and web-based application.

Features

- Machine Learning Model: A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model based on ResNet50 and VGG16 architectures is used to predict whether a cotton leaf or plant is diseased.
- Image Processing: OpenCV is used to preprocess images before feeding them into the model.
- Web Application: A Node.js and Express-based web application allows users to upload images for analysis.
- Mobile Application: A Flutter-based Android app provides farmers with a mobile interface to upload images and view results.
- User Authentication: Secure login and signup system using Node.js, EJS, and MongoDB.
- Database Management: SQL and Google Cloud are used to manage and store user data and results.
